Blog

Im trying to make a blog with what I have learnt thus far.
blog.py holds the logic for python, static contains the 
static files such as CSS and javascript. Template
holds the HTML files needed for the main site.

Controller 

The blog.py works as the controller for the site, all the data
between the server and the client is sent through the py script.
